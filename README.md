# Input-Shape
Input-Shape is a group project created by Etson Dorival and Noah Greene for our Java class. The program allows users to create shapes of various types (circles, rectangles, and triangles) and store their information for future reference.

# How to Use
 - Run the program and input the number of shapes you want to create.
- For each shape, select the type (1 for circle, 2 for rectangle, 3 for triangle), choose a color, and input the necessary dimensions (radius for circles, height and width for rectangles, and height and base for triangles).
- After creating your shapes, you can choose to display information for all circles, all rectangles, or all triangles.
- You can also choose to add another shape or exit the program.
